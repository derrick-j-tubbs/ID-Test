Infodynamics Skills Assessment

The question was to design and implement an issue tracker for a company known as Initech. They were previously only using the memory of a single support employee to track their outstanding issues with a company. This system allows a user to add a new customer, update an existing customer, add a new issue, view all customers, find issues by customer name or id, view all unresponded tickets, and find the customer id by name if necessary. All the data submitted through this is saved in a MsSql server through Azure and can be accessed at-will any time the application is launched. Data persistence was an important extra requirement for me.
